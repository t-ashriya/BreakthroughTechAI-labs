# Lab 4: Advanced Model Evaluation Techniques

## Overview
This lab focuses on comprehensive model evaluation for our Airbnb superhost classifier, implementing professional-grade validation techniques. We explore precision-recall tradeoffs, ROC analysis, and feature selection to optimize our logistic regression model's performance in predicting the `host_is_superhost` label.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Model Optimization**:
   - Conducted grid search over 10 C-values (10⁻⁵ to 10⁴)
   - Identified optimal regularization strength (C=10⁴)
   - Achieved 0.823 AUC score with tuned model

2. **Diagnostic Evaluation**:
   - Generated precision-recall curves for default vs optimized models
   - Plotted ROC curves with AUC calculations
   - Compared F1 scores at different probability thresholds

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Evaluated feature subsets using SelectKBest (k=5 to 49)
   - Discovered comprehensive feature set performed best
   - Identified top predictive features: host response metrics and review scores

4. **Model Deployment**:
   - Serialized best model using pickle
   - Implemented model persistence/loading workflow
   - Verified prediction consistency after serialization

## Key Findings
- Strong regularization (C=10⁴) improved generalization
- Full feature set outperformed reduced subsets (ΔAUC +0.015)
- Precision-recall analysis revealed optimal 0.6 decision threshold
- Model achieved robust performance across all evaluation metrics

## Files Included
1. **`model_evaluation.ipynb`**: Complete analysis notebook
2. **`precision_recall_curves.png`**: Comparison visualization
3. **`feature_importance.csv`**: Ranked feature scores
4. **`superhost_predictor.pkl`**: Deployed model file

## How to Reproduce
1. Load preprocessed data:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('airbnbData_train.csv')
```
2. Run grid search:
```python
param_grid = {'C': [10**i for i in range(-5,5)]}
grid = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(), param_grid, cv=5)
```
3. Evaluate metrics:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import PrecisionRecallDisplay
PrecisionRecallDisplay.from_estimator(model, X_test, y_test)
```

## Dependencies
- Python ≥3.8
- Libraries: scikit-learn≥1.0, matplotlib≥3.5, pandas≥1.4

## Usage Example
```python
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load and use model
with open('superhost_predictor.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Get prediction probabilities
probs = model.predict_proba(new_data)[:,1]
```

## Evaluation Metrics
| Model Version | AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|--------------|-----|-----------|--------|----|
| Default (C=1) | 0.821 | 0.72 | 0.68 | 0.70 |
| Optimized (C=10⁴) | 0.823 | 0.74 | 0.69 | 0.71 |
